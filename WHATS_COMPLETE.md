   - Click Terms → works? ✅
   - Click Contact → works? ✅
   - Back button → works? ✅

## ✨ WHAT'S NOT INCLUDED (Optional for v2)

These are nice-to-have but NOT required:
- Account settings page (change email, password, 2FA)
- Subscription management (view plan, upgrade, downgrade)
- Invoice download
